The connector J6 is pinned out as below -

VCC3V3   2   1   nc
VCC3V3   4   3   nc
VCC3V3   6   5   nc
VCC3V3   8   7   nc
VCC5V0  10   9   TXP
VCC5V0  12  11   TXN
VCC5V0  14  13   nc
nc      16  15   nc
VSS     18  17   RXP
VSS     20  19   RXN

nc = not connected. Pin 1 is indicated by the 45 degree chamfer on the
silkscreen of J6. Note the 'odd' layout of this connector. Pin 1 is
at the top RHS, not the top LHS as is more usual. I don't know why!

One thing to perhaps note is that the signals TXP,TXN,RXP,RXN are straight from
the Ethernet PHY and not via any magnetics. These are not the same signals that
appear on the output of the Ethernet RJ45 connector, J9 which go through magnetics
contained within the RJ45.
