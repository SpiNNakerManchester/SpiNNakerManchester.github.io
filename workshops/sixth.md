Our next training workshop will be held in the School of Computer Science at The University of Manchester, UK. Attendance is free, but we ask all participants to cover their own travel and subsistence costs.

The five day workshop contains a mix of lectures and hands-on labs using the SpiNNaker hardware. Teaching is supported by printed overheads and lab manuals. 
It is aimed at two groups of researchers: developers of spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience and robotics applications; and developers of new applications. To enable this we have consciously divided the workshop into two (non-overlapping) tracks. Participants can attend any and all lectures, or choose to focus on lab work, as they wish.

After a common introduction to the SpiNNaker platform and its software, topics covering spiking neural simulation will include:

 - Running neural simulations on SpiNNaker using the PyNN language
 - Visualization and working with basic SpiNNaker I/O
 - Adding new neuron and synapse models
 - Adding new learning rules
 - Connecting external devices (retinas, motors, etc.) for robotics, using AER and EIEIO protocols
 - Submitting and running neural simulations on the HBP portal
 
The non-neural track (open to all participants) looks under the hood of the SpiNNaker machine, providing much deeper understand of how applications run on the hardware, allowing new application to be written within our current tools framework. Topics include:

 - Deeper look at SpiNNaker hardware and software
 - Understanding event-driven simulation on SpiNNaker and how applications are structured
 - Using the graph front-end to specify networks for a new application on SpiNNaker (new feature)
 - Adding new mapping algorithms to the toolchain (new feature)
 - Examining machine state and debugging using YBUG and GDB

Attendees will have the opportunity to discuss their own projects with the SpiNNaker team. It may also be possible to arrange to loan one of our 4-node boards upon completion of the workshop.
