# The version described here is no longer supported. 

[Home page for current version](/) 


The SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd is a interface to the SpiNNaker software stack that is designed with the intention of allowing developers / users to 
build applications that run on SpiNNaker machines without having to worry about the low level support of:

1. Booting/powering on the SpiNNaker machine.
1. Mapping the application onto the SpiNNaker machine.
1. Loading the application onto the SpiNNaker machine.
1. Buffering data in/out from/to to the SpiNNaker machine during an application run.
1. Reducing the ethernet bandwidth.
1. Verifying that the application is running on the SpiNNaker machine.
1. Implementing a interface for interacting with the SpiNNaker machine.
1. Acquiring Provenance data from the SpiNNaker machine after an application run.
1. Acquiring debug data from the SpiNNaker machine after / during an application run.
1. Shutting down the SpiNNaker machine correctly after an application run.

# How the SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd supports the developer/user

The SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd allows a developer / user to write applications by representing the problem as a graph, where the
nodes in the graph represent a collection of computation and edges represent communication between these computations. 

The developer should read the [SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd new application tutorial](SpiNNakerGraphFrontEndAddNewApplicationTutorial.html) to learn how to 
exploit the software stack to it's most potential. A summary is that a developer needs to develop both a python and c representation of any computation nodes (vertices) and often just a python version for any unique communication requirements. 

# SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd interface

The SpiNNakerGraphFrontEnd supports the following interface for developers to use.

|Name|Definition|
|:----------|:----------------------------|
|setup()|This is the first call that needs to be executed at all times. It sets up all the basic data structures the software stack requires|
|add_partitionable_vertex()|This adds a vertex that can be split over multiple computational nodes|
|add_partitioned_vertex()|This adds a vertex that can only reside on one computational node|
|add_partitionable_edge()|This adds a edge between vertices that can be split over multiple computational nodes|
|add_partitioned_edge()|This adds a edge between vertices that can only reside on individual computational nodes|
|read_partitionable_graph_xml_file()|This function supports reading in a graph, represented in XML, containing vertices which can be split over multiple computational nodes|
|read_partitioned_graph_xml_file()|This function supports reading in a graph, represented in XML, containing vertices which can only reside on individual computational nodes|
|get_machine_dimensions()|This function supports inquiring the SpiNNaker machine and being given the dimensions of the machine|
|machine()|This function returns the python representation of the SpiNNaker machine|
|transceiver()| This function returns the python communication interface to the SpiNNaker machine| 
|run()|This function executes: mapping, loading, running, extraction of provenance and debug data on the SpiNNaker machine|
|stop()|This function shuts down the SpiNNaker machine cleanly|

To be extended in the future.
