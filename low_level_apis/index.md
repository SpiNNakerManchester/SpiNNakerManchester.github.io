title: Low Level APIs
---

Work is in progress to develop a low-level interface for application development on SpiNNaker, allowing more direct access to (among other things) the place-and-route algorithms in PACMAN and the transceiver in SpiNNMan.

 * [SpiNNUtils](https://spinnutils.readthedocs.org) — General utility code that is not SpiNNaker-specific.
 * [SpiNNMachine](https://spinnmachine.readthedocs.org) — Model of the SpiNNaker machine hardware.
 * [SpiNNMan](https://spinnman.readthedocs.org) — Classes for communicating with a SpiNNaker machine.
 * [PACMAN](https://pacman.readthedocs.org) — Algorithms for configuring a piece of software to run on a specific SpiNNaker machine.
 * [DataSpecification](http://dataspecification.readthedocs.org) — System for efficiently loading data onto SpiNNaker hardware.
 * [SpiNNFrontEndCommon](https://spinnfrontendcommon.readthedocs.org) — Common layer for running SpiNNaker applications on a SpiNNaker machine.
